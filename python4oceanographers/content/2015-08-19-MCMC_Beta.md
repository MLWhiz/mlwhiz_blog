One of the newest and best resources that you can keep an eye on is the [Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml?siteID=lVarvwc5BD0-AqkGMb7JzoCMW0Np1uLfCA&utm_content=2&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=lVarvwc5BD0) course in the [Advanced machine learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml?siteID=lVarvwc5BD0-AqkGMb7JzoCMW0Np1uLfCA&utm_content=2&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=lVarvwc5BD0) created jointly by Kazanova(Number 3 Kaggler at the time of writing)

Apart from that I also found a course on **[Bayesian Statistics on Coursera](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=lVarvwc5BD0&offerid=495576.8910375858&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fbayesian)**. In the process of doing it right now so couldn't really comment on it. But since I had done an course on **[Inferential Statistics](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=lVarvwc5BD0&offerid=495576.8839843074&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Finferential-statistics-intro)** taught by the same professor before(Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel), I am very hopeful for this course. Let's see.

Also look out for these two books to learn more about MCMC. I have not yet read them whole but still I liked whatever I read:

Both these books are pretty high level and hard on math. But these are the best texts out there too. :)
